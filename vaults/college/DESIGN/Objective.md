- Develop a system to evaluate my son's high-school grades and compare against college acceptance criteria.  
	- Need to track and update (as they change) high-school letter grades (e.g., a, a-).  Grades will need to be manually added. 
	- Compute a GPA using standard and specific college criteria
	- Compute WHAT IF scenarios to evaluate the next several semesters of high-school and GPA.  This will be used to make decisions on classes and focus.
- Download college acceptance criteria from authoritative locations.
	- View list of all college data available
	- Configure specific colleges for download and analysis
- Generate reports on schools 
	- Filter / group by geographic location
	- Add additional criteria as the data sets enable

- Use uv for environment management, python and Jupiter notebooks where appropriate.
- Do not hallucinate.  Ask questions and clarify.
- Design, approve, build and test.   Work with the human to ensure efficiency in development.
